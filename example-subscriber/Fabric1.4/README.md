To install all the prerequisites, run the setup.sh script.

### Start the network

To start the network, run the runApp.sh script. Before using the network, a new user should be created for each organization. Then a cannel should be created and both organization should join the channel. Finally, the chaincode should be installed and instantiated. You can run the client.py file to make all these happen.
